# Hugo syntax for Sublime Text 3

A collection of Sublime Text 3 configuration files, adapted to correctly highlight Hugo files: Markdown and Templates.

## Content

- *Markdown-Hugo.sublime-syntax*: Add correct highlighting to Front Mater and Shortcodes, in .md files.
- *HTML-Hugo.sublime-syntax*: Add correct highlighting to the code between `{{ }}`, in .html files.
- *Hugo Highlight Dark.sublime-color-scheme* and *Hugo Highlight Light.sublime-color-scheme*: Color schemes adapted for a better chromatic difference between segments.

Each file can be installed separately. Simply create a new 'Hugo-syntax' directory to store them under <data_path>/Installed Packages/. You can access this directory from the Preferences â–¶ Browse Packages menu.

Inside the directory <data_path>/Packages/Hugo-syntax paste the files you want to use.
